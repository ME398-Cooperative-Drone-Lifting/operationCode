# Operation Code
Code for Running on Drone-Hub system

# To operate the RealSense camera in this framework:
## Option 1: Restore from image backup
- **Do not even think about doing this without Benjamin's help!**


# Disable BT and add UART for dronekit
dtoverlay=disable-bt
enable_uart=1

## Option 2: Set up from scratch
### Prerequisites (single-time setup) [estimated time: 1-1.5 hours]
- Plug a 64 GB microSD card into your computer
- Install Ubuntu 22.04 for a Raspberry Pi 4B with the Raspberry Pi imager app
- Keep the SD attached to your computer, and open the `system-boot` directory
- Extend the USBfs buffer size to 2048 MB with the following step:
    - Add `usbcore.usbfs_memory_mb=2048` to the `cmdline.txt` file in the `/boot/` directory (using sd card adapter)
- Save the .txt file, eject the card, and insert it into the Pi (shiny 'pins' facing up into the PCB)
- Boot up the Pi and set it up **without WiFi**
- Once you're at the main desktop and logged in properly, begin setting up WiFi on the Pi
    - Using a personal computer already connected to WiFi, download the certificate from [here](https://services.northwestern.edu/TDClient/30/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=1113) and copy it to a USB-A type thumb drive
    - Copy the certificate from the thumb drive onto the Pi desktop
    - Go to settings, select eduroam, select Protected EAP, upload certificate, set MSCHAPv2, add your username and password
    - Username: `netid@u.northwestern.edu`, password: `yourpassword`
- Update all system programs with `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade`
- Install Python's `pip` module with `sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip`
- Install Python 3.7 with the following steps:
    - `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa`
    - `sudo apt install -y python3.7 && sudo apt install -y python3.7-distutils`
- Install `openssh-server` with `sudo apt-get -y install openssh-server` on the Pi 4
    - Once the SSH server is set up, check the IP address in Settings/WiFi and write it down for recurring use in the execution section
- Install `video4linux` drivers with `sudo apt-get -y install v4l-utils`, required to assign udev rules
- Install DroneKit with `python3.7 -m pip install dronekit`
#### If you are installing the RealSense SDK:
- Install the RealSense SDK 2.0 on the Pi 4. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/blob/master/doc/installation.md), taking care not to install the kernel patches.
- Install opencv-contrib-python (includes additional libraries) with `python3.7 -m pip install opencv-contrib-python`
- Install the Python RealSense bindings with `python3.7 -m pip install pyrealsense2`

### Execution (must be repeated each time)
- `ssh` into the Pi with the following argument:
    - `ssh -X pi@<ip_address>` (replace `<ip_address>` with the Pi's IP address)
- Go to the proper directory with `cd operationCode/realsenseOps/`
- Set up the RealSense display with `export DISPLAY=:0`
- Run `rs-enumerate-devices` to prime the RealSense USB buffer (mysterious, please do not ask why this works)
- Run the DroneKit code OR directly run the RealSense script with `python3 arucoTrack.py`
- If necessary, close the script with CTRL+C
- If you want to run either script again, you **must** run `rs-enumerate-devices` again before execution!

### Troubleshooting
- If the connection times out, unplug the RealSense camera, wait 3-5 seconds, and then replug in the other USB 3.0 port
- The scripts will **likely** work if `rs-enumerate-devices` yields an immediate response
    - If `rs-enumerate-devices` hangs or takes more than 2 seconds to execute, unplug the camera and try again


# To (theoretically) port the DroneKit operation code to Python 3.10 or newer:
- On macOS, go to `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/lib/python3.12/site-packages/dronekit/init.py` or the equivalent version for your Python installation
- Change `class Parameters(collections.MutableMapping, HasObservers):` to `class Parameters(collections.abc.MutableMapping, HasObservers):` (add the .abc. between collections and MutableMapping)
